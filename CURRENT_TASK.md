## Last session work (2026-04-26)

### Jira UI gaps implemented

**Gap 1 — Cell Inspector panel (MEDIUM)**
- `LevelEditorSession.MarkDirty()` exposed (was private-setter only)
- `CellInspectorPanel` (new): renders `DrawInspector` for the selected grid cell; sits between Validation (50%) and Summary in the right column (130px fixed)
- Right column layout: Validation (50%) → Cell Inspector (130px) → Summary (remaining)

**Gap 2 — Per-color validation breakdown (MEDIUM)**
- `YarnColorBalanceRule` now emits `ValidationSeverity.Info` entries per color (always shown as a balance table); Error entries still fire for imbalanced colors
- `ValidationPanel` already rendered Info with blue rows — no panel change needed

**Gap 3 — Notes field + improved Summary (MEDIUM)**
- `LevelDocument.LevelMetadata.Notes` (string, serialized as `"notes"`)
- `SummaryPanel` shows `DisplayName` from registry instead of raw TypeId for cell counts; Notes textarea pinned to bottom (editable, calls `MarkDirty`)

### Brush template system
- `LevelEditorSession.BrushTemplate` — pre-configured cell template for next paint stroke
- `LevelEditorSession.CloneBrushTemplate()` — round-trips template through `JsonLevelSerializer` to produce a fresh instance per painted cell
- `PalettePanel` split into cell list (top, scrollable) + BRUSH section (96px bottom); clicking a cell type resets `BrushTemplate`; `DrawInspector` runs on the brush so color/direction/queue are configurable before painting
- `GridCanvasPanel.PlaceAt` uses `CloneBrushTemplate()` instead of `CreateDefault()`

### Color swatch pickers
- `ColorSwatchDrawer` (new, core Editor): reusable wrapping swatch grid with selected/hover borders and tooltip
- `YarnBoxCellDefinition.DrawInspector`: swatches + Hidden toggle
- `YarnArrowBoxCellDefinition.DrawInspector`: swatches + direction EnumPopup
- `YarnTunnelCellDefinition.DrawInspector`: rewritten with absolute rects (removes `GUILayout.BeginArea` that caused right-panel text overflow); queue entries show click-to-cycle color swatch
- `YarnTopSectionPanel`: spool rows show swatch strip + hidden toggle; `PreferredHeight` is now dynamic (was hardcoded for 9 spools)

## Open items / known gaps

### Manual steps still needed
- [ ] Open `YarnTwistProfile.asset` in Inspector → set `_schemaId` to `yarn-twist` (currently `yarn-twist.v1` causes `yarn-twist.v1.v1` in Summary)
- [ ] Assign `YarnTwistPalette` to `_palette` field on `YarnTunnelCellDef.asset` (same as Box/ArrowBox) so queue entry swatches show colors
- [ ] Smoke test: open Level Editor → YarnTwistProfile → paint boxes + spools → Save → verify `level_config.json` updated in YarnTwist project

### Low-priority Jira gaps (not implemented)
- Arrow box / tunnel target cell highlight (highlight destination cell when selected)
- Top View (Preview) mini-panel in right column
- Copy Level ID button in toolbar/summary

### Remaining open questions
- [ ] Confirm `YATColorType` int values with game team and lock `YarnColorMapping.asset`
- [ ] Grid offset `−3.5f` fix (when grid dimensions become variable)
- [ ] ArrowBox + Tunnel full prefab implementation in game
- [ ] Camera auto-fit wiring
- [ ] Win/lose flow restoration

## Key design notes (carry forward)

- `GridData` is bottomUp: y=0 = bottom row in data, drawn at bottom of canvas
- First cell type in `GameProfile.CellTypes` must be the "empty" type (erase + fill)
- `PushUndoSnapshot()` must be called BEFORE mutations (not after)
- `CloneBrushTemplate()` is the correct way to get a fresh painted cell — never store `BrushTemplate` reference directly in the grid
- `DrawInspector` must use absolute `GUI.*` / `EditorGUI.*` calls — never `GUILayout.BeginArea` (causes render leaks outside panel bounds)
- `ColorSwatchDrawer.Draw()` is the reusable swatch picker for any `ColorPaletteAsset`
- `YarnColorBalanceRule` emits Info entries (color table) + Error entries (imbalances) — both appear in `ValidationPanel`
- `ScriptableObjectExporter.Export()` only works when .json path is inside `Assets/`
- `LevelAsset.ApplyJson` is internal — only callable from Editor assembly
- `GameProfile.CreateTopSection()` uses `MonoScript.GetClass()` + `Activator.CreateInstance`
- `GridCanvasPanel.HoverCell` is public — read by `LevelEditorWindow` status bar
- `LevelEditorSession.MarkDirty()` is the safe way to flag unsaved state from panels (replaces `PushUndoSnapshot()` for non-grid mutations like Notes edits)
